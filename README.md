# NVCC/NOVA Tech Club

## About Us
This is the official GitHub Organization for NVCC's Tech Enthusiast Club.

We are currently working on these two projects for the semester:
- **[Slope Game Remake](https://github.com/NVCC-Tech-Club/SlopeGame)**: A remake of the [Slope Online Game](https://slopeonline.online/slope-game) programming with Java using LWJGL.
- **[Tech Club Official Website](https://github.com/NVCC-Tech-Club/techclubsite)**: Our official website for club members to navigate and learn more about the club.
